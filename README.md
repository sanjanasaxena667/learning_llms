🚀 LangChain Learning Journey
This repository tracks my progress as I dive into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) using LangChain. I am currently exploring how to build efficient, scalable AI applications using various orchestration techniques and models.

🛠️ Projects
1. English-to-French Translator (Work in Progress)
A language translation tool built using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL). This project focuses on creating a clean, declarative chain to handle prompt templates and model responses.

Model: llama-3.1-8b-instant via Groq.

Key Feature: High-speed translation leveraging Groq's LPUs.

Status: Currently optimizing the LCEL chain for complex sentence structures.

2. Gemma Local Chatbot
A GPT-style conversational interface that runs entirely on local hardware. This project helped me understand how to integrate local LLM runners with LangChain for privacy-focused AI apps.

Model: gemma2:2b via Ollama.

Key Feature: Zero-latency local inference with a chat-history-aware interface.

🧰 Tech Stack
Framework: LangChain

Models: Llama 3.1 (Groq), Gemma 2 (Ollama)

Environment: Python, Dotenv (for secure API management)
